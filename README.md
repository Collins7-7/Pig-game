This is a simple game made using Javascript, CSS and HTML.
The game is played by two players, the first player roles the dice as many times as he wants and presses hold to hold their score and the game goes to the second player who can play the game the same way as player one. The player who gets to a total score of 100 first wins the game. The challenge is when a player roles a one their current score goes back to zero and the game shifts to their opponent to role the dice. This means that it's very vital to know when to hold your current score in order to add it into your total score before rolling a one and losing your current score and giving the advantage to your opponent.

Enjoy!
